# Git Setup
## Creating a GitHub Account
In order to use GitHub for the lab (and for future projects!) you will need to make a personal GitHub account if you do not already have one.
- [ ] Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com)
- [ ] Click "sign up" in the top right corner and fill in the prompts for your email, password, and username.

## Installing GitHub Desktop
We will be interacting with GitHub via the GitHub Desktop Application!

- [ ] [Download and install](https://desktop.github.com/) the latest version of GitHub Desktop
- [ ] [Authenticate](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/authenticating-to-github) to GitHub in the desktop application so that you can access your account.

You can also interact with GitHub using the Git Command Line Interface (CLI) but this is beyond the scope of thus activity. You can learn more about the Git CLI commands and installation [Here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line).
